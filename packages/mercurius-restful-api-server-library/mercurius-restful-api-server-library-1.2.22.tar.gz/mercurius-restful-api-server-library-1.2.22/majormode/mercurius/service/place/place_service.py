            to search nearby places.  The function uses the argument `radius`
            to define the search area.

            return them.  If both `limit` and `offset` are specified, then

            `client_ip_address`.

              information of this component, written in the specified locale when
              available, or in the default locale.

            * `category` (optional): The code name of a category qualifying the
              place.

            * `contacts` (optional): A list of objects `Contact`.

              specifies the location of the place's logo picture.

            * `place_id` (required): The identification of the place.

            * `score` (optional): An estimation of the probability that the place is
              relevant to the search, given the intent.  A perfect precision score
              of `1.0` means that the place returned is totally relevant.  This
              value is only returned if the intent of the search is `checkin` or
              `social`.

            * `update_time` (required): The time of the most recent modification of
              one or more attributes of this place.
