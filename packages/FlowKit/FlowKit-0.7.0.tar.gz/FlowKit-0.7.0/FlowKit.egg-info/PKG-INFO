## Overview

FlowKit is an intuitive Python toolkit for flow cytometry analysis and visualization, with full support for the [GatingML 2.0 standard](http://flowcyt.sourceforge.net/gating/latest.pdf) and limited support for FlowJo 10 workspace files.

**Version 0.6 added experimental support for exporting FlowJo 10 workspace files from a Session. Support is currently limited to exporting data from a single sample group. Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit/issues/new/choose) if you find any bugs related to this feature.**

## Features

* Read / Write FCS Files
  * Read FCS files, supporting FCS versions 2.0, 3.0, and 3.1
  * Export FCS data as:
    * A new FCS 3.1 file, with modified metadata and/or filtered events
    * NumPy array
    * Pandas DataFrame
    * CSV text file
* Compensation
  * Compensate events using spillover matrices from:
    * $SPILL or $SPILLOVER keyword value
    * FlowJo tab-delimited text
    * NumPy array
    * GatingML 2.0 spectrumMatrix XML element
  * Create a compensation matrix from a set of compensation bead files
* Transformation
  * Support for a variety of transformations used in the flow community:
    * Logicle
    * Inverse hyperbolic sine (ArcSinh)
    * FlowJo Bi-exponential
    * Hyperlog
    * Logarithmic
    * Channel ratios
    * Linear
* Gating
  * Full support for the GatingML 2.0 specification
    * Import GatingML XML documents as gating strategies
    * Export gating strategies as a valid GatingML XML document
  * Limited support for importing FlowJo 10 workspace files. Workspace files are currently limited to the following features:
    * Linear, logarithmic, bi-exponential, and logicle transforms
    * Polygon, rectangle, ellipse, and quadrant gates
  * Programmatically create gating strategies including polygon, rectangle, range, ellipsoid, quadrant, and boolean gates
  * Easily retrieve gating results from a gating strategy as a Pandas DataFrame. Results include:
    * FCS sample ID
    * Gate name
    * Parent gate
    * Gate path
    * Gate level (position in gate hierarchy tree)  
    * Absolute event count
    * Relative percentage
    * Absolute percentage
* Visualization
  * Histogram of single channel data
  * Contour density plot of two channels
  * Interactive scatter plot of two channels
  * Interactive scatter plot matrix of any combination of channels
  * Interactive scatter plots of gates with sample events

## Requirements

FlowKit supports Python version 3.6 or above. All dependencies are installable 
via pip, and are listed below.

***Note: FlowKit and FlowUtils use C extensions for significant performance 
improvements. If using `gcc`, version 5 or 
above is required for correct Logicle and Hyperlog transformations.***

Required Python dependencies:

* [flowio](https://github.com/whitews/flowio) == 0.9.11
* [flowutils](https://github.com/whitews/flowutils) == 0.9.4
* numpy >= 1.19
* scipy >= 1.3
* statsmodels
* pandas >= 1.1
* matplotlib >= 3.1
* seaborn >= 0.11
* bokeh >= 1.4
* lxml >= 4.4
* anytree >= 2.6

## Installation

### From PyPI

```
pip install flowkit
```

### From source

```
git clone https://github.com/whitews/flowkit
cd flowkit

python setup.py install
```
