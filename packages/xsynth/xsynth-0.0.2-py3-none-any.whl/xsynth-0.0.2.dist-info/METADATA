# XSynth

XSynth is a command line tool for synthesing applications. It is a key
component of the QuickDev system. As a stand-alone application it is
a pre-processor for multiple languages include python, javascript
and html.
 
I have been using bits and pieces of this for over two decades. This
is a very early release of code that I am origanizing and documenting
for use by others.
