# Installation

```sh
$ pip install OmeglePy
```

# Quick Start Guide

To get started using the API follow the instructions below.

## Examples

For more examples, check the [examples](examples) folder.

``` python
from OmeglePy import OmegleClient, EventHandler

client = OmegleClient(EventHandler(), topics=['tiktok'], debug=False)
client.start()

while True:

    # Get input
    message = input()
    
    # Go to the next person
    if message.lower() == "/next":
        client.loop.creatae_task(client.skip())
        continue
    
    # Send a message
    client.loop.create_task(client.send(message))
```

## Events

List of events accessible by the default provided ``EventHandler``. 

* **identDigests** - Identification received from the server
* **systemError** - When a critical error happens & an event can't be retrieved (typically proxy stuff)
* **statusInfo** - When status info is received from the server
* **onlineCount** - When a count of all online people is received from the Client
* **waiting** - When the server states you are waiting for a connection
* **connected** - When you connect to someone
* **commonLikes** - A list of the common likes between you and a stranger
* **strangerDisconnected** - When a stranger disconnects
* **typing** - When a stranger starts typing
* **stoppedTyping** - When a stranger stops typing
* **clientTyping** - When you start typing
* **clientStoppedTyping** - When you stop typing
* **gotMessage** - When you receive a message
* **clientMessage** - When you send a message
* **clientChangedTopics** - When you change your topics
* **clientSkip** - When you skip
* **recaptchaRequired** - When the server requests a captcha (You got Blocked!)
* **antinudeBanned** - When the server sends an antinude ban (You got Blocked!)
* **softBanned** - When the server sends no data back (You got Blocked!)

Inherit the ``AbstractEventHandler`` class to implement your own custom events, or (my suggestion) inheret the ``EventHandler`` class and just edit specific events you want different from the ones already handled. Remember, you can add on by calling the super of that method too, instead of copy-pasting code ``await super(EventHandler, self).<method_name>(data)`` if you're trying to add to a handled event instead of edit it.

``` python
class MyCustomHandler(EventHandler):
    
    async def connected(self, data):
        """
        Run what the inherited handler does, but also send a message...
        """
        await super(EventHandler, self).connected(data)
        await self.instance.send('You should know, I'm super cool...')
    
    async def softBanned(self, data):
        """
        Ignore what the inherited handler does, run my own code...
        """
        await self.instance.stop()  # Stops the bot
    
```

## OmeglePy

``OmeglePy`` uses some optional initial parameters, these are them:

* **event_handler=EventHandler()** - The event handler for events to be passed into
* **event_frequency=5** - The frequency in which requests are made to retrieve events
* **loop=YourLoopHere** - An asyncio loop if you want to pass one in if one has already been created
* **server=1** - The omegle server (integer #) to connect to
* **topics=['tiktok']** - A list of topics you want to search for in common with others
* **language='en'** - The two-letter language code (e.g: en)
* **debug=False** - Whether or not you want debug logs in the console
* **proxy=``http://user:pass@hostname:port``** - An optional proxy if you want one of those
* **mobile=False** - Whether or not to connect as a mobile client
* **unmonitored=False** - Whether or not to enter the unmonitored section
* **socket_connect_timeout=15** - The max time (seconds) to connect to the socket during a request
