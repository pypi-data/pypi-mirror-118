# Plover Combo

A plugin for [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover) that adds a Combo counter. Inspired by the [Code in the Dark Editor](https://github.com/codeinthedark/editor).

## Usage Notes

- `Ctrl/Cmd + S` to open settings, `Ctrl/Cmd + X` to close widget. 
- Left click on the counter number and drag to move the widget around. (On some systems, you'll have to click on the opaque areas of the font.)
- On macOS, you might experience repainting issues where a ghost image appears behind the counter when the background opacity is set to 0. To fix this, try opening the settings with `Cmd + S` and change the background opacity to 1.
