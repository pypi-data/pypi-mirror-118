Description: # Welcome to clean_plot
        > The library simplifies cleaning text files for creation of embeddings and making plots from it
        
        
        ## Install
        
        `pip install clean-plot`
        
        ## How to use
        
        The library contains easy to use methods for cleaning text, tokenizing and lemmatizing sentences. These sentences can then be easily fed to a sentence encoder to create sentence embeddings.
        
        ```python
        fname = '../files/dummy.txt'
        text = get_data(fname)
        print(text)
        ```
        
            MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt
            whatever about that. The register of his burial was
            signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
            and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and
            Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he
            chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a
            door-nail.
            
            Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my
            own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about
            a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to
            regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery
            in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors
            is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands
            shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You
            will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that
            Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
        
        
        ```python
        sentences = make_sentences(text)

        ```

             "Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to.",

             'Mind!',
             "I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail.",
             'I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade.',
