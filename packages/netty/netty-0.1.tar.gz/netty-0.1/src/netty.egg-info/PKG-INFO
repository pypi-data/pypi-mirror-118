# netty
A simple python library for networking. Not extremely complex, but allows for simple game servers and chat rooms to be hosted.

# Documentation

This example will show you how to make a simple chat room with `netty`.

First, import netty:
```python
import netty
```
Then, choose a port and make a client and a server:
```python
import netty

PORT = 3000

client = netty.connection.Client('', PORT) # args: IP ('' for local), and port.

server = netty.connection.Server(PORT) # args: port to run the server on.
```
Now, we have a client and a server, but they aren't doing anything when they get a message. To do this, we need to add a `onReceive` argument to the client and server.
