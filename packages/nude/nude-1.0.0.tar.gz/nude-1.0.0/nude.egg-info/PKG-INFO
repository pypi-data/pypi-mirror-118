Description: # Nude
        
        Turn clothed women nude
        
        ## Install
        
        Run `pip3 install git+https://github.com/NudeProject/NudeProject` in the terminal
        
        On Linux (Ubuntu) you would have to run `sudo apt-get install python3-tk -y` if you want to use the GUI
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### With CLI
        
        Run `nude-cli -i <INPUT> -o <OUTPUT>` in the terminal
        
        (Replace `<INPUT>` with the input file and `<OUTPUT>` with the name for the output file)
        
        In the CLI there are more features (that the GUI doesn't have yet) that can be viewed using `nude-cli -h`
        
        ### With GUI
        
        Run `nude-gui` in the terminal
