Bamboo-engine is a general-purpose process engine which can parse, 
execute and schedule process tasks created by users, and provides flexible control capabilities such as pause, revoke, skip, force failure, retry and re-execute,
and advanced features such as parallelism and sub-processes. 
It can further improve the concurrent processing ability of tasks through horizontal expansion.
