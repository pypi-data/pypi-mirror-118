## EVer - A Library for Earth Vision Researcher


EVer is a Pytorch-based Python library to simplify the training and inference of the deep learning model.

> This is a **beta** version for research only.


## Features

- Common codebase for reproducible research
- Accelerating our Earth Vision research
- Single workflow of "data-module-configs"


## Installation

### stable version (0.2.2)
```bash
pip install ever-beta==0.2.2
```

### nightly version (master)
