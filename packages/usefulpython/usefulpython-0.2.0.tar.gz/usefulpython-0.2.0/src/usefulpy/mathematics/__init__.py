  Version 1.0.0
   Entirety of folder restructured. Much improved use of mathfuncs. Expression
   check has taken the place of eq and algebraic solver. Basic CAS implemented
   for the new mathfunc-eq-solver merge. Greater efficiency and power to most
   other areas. nmath made much smaller, most of its functionality has been
   moved to the mathfunc file.
