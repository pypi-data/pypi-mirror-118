RELEASE NOTES:
Pre releases
 Pr 1
  Pr 1a:
   Capable of passing 3d points to 2d points.
   Not sure how to make this into a frame... in fact, I didn't think this
   through I only worked out the math part in my head, checked it on desmos
   (see https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bnk7wnndk1) and ... opened the .py
   document...

   The way this works is that you imagine a 3d vector from a point to an 'eye'
   (a point with a plane in front of it), where this vector intersects with the
   plane (in the plane) is where the point should be graphed at.
 Pr 2
  Pr 2a
   space object will hold figures and cameras. cameras now belong to a space.
   cameras have orientation and location with precomputations that allow
   it to pass 3d point methods for moving about
   A camera has two projection possibilities. project projects a point from the
   space while project1 projects an object that seems to hover in front of it
   though changes with orientation. (this is for an axis, for example: see
   newaxis in the desmos)
  Pr 2b
   The addition of figure classes.
   Figures can now be added to a space.

 0.0
  Version 0.0.0:
   Now can work with a canvas.
  Version 0.0.1:
   Now works with colors
   small bugfixes regarding objects going 'behind' a camera causing errors.
  Version 0.0.2:
   Better updating abilities
   Increased performance
   Increased handling
  Version 0.0.3:
   Stiched panes of 3d figures. (there was a gap between the panes)
 0.1
  Version 0.1.0:
   Heavy testing and debugging in movement... no more upside-down/backward/
   inverted movement when trying to navigate a 3d space. Also nicer loading.
  Version 0.1.1:
   make rectangle function... pseudo-shades the rectangles
   this is a placeholder for the actual shading abilities.
