SORA v0.1 (2020/May/20)
=======================

Classes
-------

The documentation of all classes and functions are on their docstrings,
while the scientific part is presented in the full documentation.
Here follows a list with the main Classes:

**Ephem** Three Classes created to generate geocentric ephemeris for a given solar system object.
**EphemJPL** queries the JPL Horizons service and download ephemeris information.
**EphemKernel** reads the BSP files to calculate the ephemeris using the Spiceypy package.
**EphemPlanet** reads an ASCII file with previously determined positions and interpolate them for a given instant.

JPL Horizons - https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi

**Star** Class created to deal with the star parameters. From the Gaia-DR2 Source ID
or a sky region, it queries the VizieR service and downloads the star’s information.
From Gaia DR2 Catalog (Gaia Collaboration 2016a, 2016b and 2018) it gets the RA, DEC,
parallax, proper motions, G magnitude and star radius; from the NOMAD Catalog
(Zacharias et al. 2004) it gets the B, V, R, J, H and K magnitudes.
The user can calculate the ICRS coordinate of the star at any epoch.
It can be barycentric (corrected from proper motion) or geocentric (corrected
from proper motion and parallax). Also, the apparent diameter of the star is calculated
using Gaia DR2 information, or some models such as Van Belle (1999) and  Kervella et al. (2004).

Gaia - Gaia Collaboration 2016a, 2016b and 2018
Mission: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A\%26A...595A...1G/abstract
DR1: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A\%26A...595A...2G/abstract
DR2: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A\%26A...616A...1G/abstract
VizieR - https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR
NOMAD - Zacharias et al. 2004 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AAS...205.4815Z/abstract
Van Belle, 1999 - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999PASP..111.1515V/abstract
Kervella, 2004 - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004A%26A...426..297K/abstract

**Observer**: Object Class created to deal with the observer location. The user can
also download the ground-based observatories from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database.

MPC sites - https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/ObsCodesF.html

**Light Curve**: Object Class that receives the observational light curve (with time
and the occulted star normalized photometry relative to reference stars) and some
observational parameters (filter and exposure time). It has functions to determine
the instants that the solar system object enters in front of the star and leaves,
(immersion and emersion times, respectively). The model considers a sharp-edge
occultation model (geometric) convolved with Fresnel diffraction, stellar diameter
(projected at the body distance) and finite integration time (Widemann et al.,
2009; Sicardy et al., 2011</font>).

Widemann et al. 2009 -  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009Icar..199..458W/abstract
Sicardy et al. 2011 -  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Natur.478..493S/abstract

**Occultation**: Main Object Class within SORA, created to analyze stellar
occultations, and control all the other Object Classes within this package.
Its functions allow converting the times for each observatory in the occulted
body positions in the sky plane relative to the occulted star (f, g) (IERS
Conventions). Also, to obtain the best ellipse parameters (centre position,
apparent equatorial radius, oblateness and the position angle of the apparent
polar radius) that fit the points. The results are the apparent size, shape and
astrometrical position of the occulting body.

IERS Conventions: https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/TechnicalNotes/tn36.html

Some extra Objects Classes:

**PredictionTable**: Using the **prediction** function within SORA results in an
Object Class that is a slight modification of an AstropyTable. The added changes
allow to create the occultation map for each prediction, convert into specific
formats, such as OccultWatcher and PRAIA (Assafin et al. (2011)).

OccultWatcher - https://www.occultwatcher.net/
Assafin et al., 2011 - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011gfun.conf...85A/abstract

**ChiSquare**: This Object Class is the result of the fitting functions within
SORA, such as _LightCurve.occ_lcfit()_ and _Occultation.fit_ellipse()_.
This Class has functions that allow viewing the values that minimize the :math:`{\chi^2}`
tests, the uncertainties within :math:`{n\sigma}`, plotting the tests, and saving the values.
