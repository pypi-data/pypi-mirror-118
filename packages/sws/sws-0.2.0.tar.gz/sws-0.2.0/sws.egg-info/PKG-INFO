### Roadmap

A full roadmap for each project version can be found here: https://github.com/Descent098/sws/projects

## Why should I use sws?

The best marketing pitch that I can give you is that it's easy to use, free, and open source. The project really is here so that people don't have to keep writing the same implementations of basic tasks, and can instead use a tested package that contains a ton of functionality. Additionally if you don't want to use all of sws's features, because it is MIT liscenced you can feel free to vendor functions within your own project.

## Who is sws for?

Really it can be used by anyone, but here are the most typial use cases:
- Web developers; tools provided in sws can help with debugging and validating web servers
- Devops Specialists & testers; can use sws api to automate validation that servers are running how they should be
- People learning webdev; Sometimes getting access to tooling while learning webdev can be difficult, this can be a one-stop shop for lots of functionality
- Scripters; people who are looking to use sws functionality in their own projects
