# docker-load-graph
---

Have you ever been working with a docker stack, and been interested in how your containers fair over time? Me too.

This project exists to solve that problem.

## What does it do?

Very simply this project uses [plotext](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext) to display the current status
of key [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container metrics in real time on the command line.

## How do I use it?

I've uploaded this project to the PYPA repository for pip to access. You can simply install this using `python3.7>` with
```
pip install docker-load-graph
```

To execute this project run:

```
docker-load-graph
```

It is just that simple.
