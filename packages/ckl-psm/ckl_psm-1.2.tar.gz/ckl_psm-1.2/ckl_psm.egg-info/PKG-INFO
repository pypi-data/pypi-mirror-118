        ### How to build  
        
        ```bash
        cd backend
        # Install ckl_psm to current python environment
        python setup.py install
        ```
        or install by pip
        
        ```bash
        pip install ckl-psm
        ```
        
        ### How to use  
        
        ```python
        # Import ckl_psm and make sure you have installed the library
        from ckl_psm import ckl_pcfg as psm
        
        # Strength query for given password
        result = psm.check_pwd("123456")
        
        # The result is consist of four parts:
        print(
            result["guess_number"],
            result["segments"],
            result["chunks"],
