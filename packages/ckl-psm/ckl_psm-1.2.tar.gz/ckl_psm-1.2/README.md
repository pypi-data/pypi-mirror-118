# Install ckl_psm to current python environment
python setup.py install
```
or install by pip

```

### How to use  

```python
# Import ckl_psm and make sure you have installed the library
from ckl_psm import ckl_pcfg as psm

# Strength query for given password
result = psm.check_pwd("123456")

# The result is consist of four parts:
print(
    result["guess_number"],
    result["segments"],
    result["chunks"],
    result["prob"]
