# Telemetry-F1-2021

# Main Source for this Project
To speed up the building of this project, the packet format was taken from
[this](https://forums.codemasters.com/topic/80231-f1-2021-udp-specification/?do=findComment&comment=624274)
post on the Codemasters forums.

Thanks to the hard work of the poster I was able to skip the tedious packet decoding.
