def fractal_katz(signal):

    """Computes Katz's Fractal Dimension (KFD), based on euclidean distances between
    successive points in the signal which are summed and averaged,
    and the maximum distance between the starting and any other point in the sample.

    Here, fractal dimensions range from 1.0 for straight lines, through
    approximately 1.15 for random-walk waveforms, to approaching 1.5 for the most
    convoluted waveforms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The signal (i.e., a time series) in the form of a vector of values.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Katz's fractal dimension.

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>>
    >>> signal = nk.signal_simulate(duration=2, frequency=5, noise=10)
    >>>
    >>> kfd = nk.fractal_katz(signal)
    >>> kfd #doctest: +SKIP
