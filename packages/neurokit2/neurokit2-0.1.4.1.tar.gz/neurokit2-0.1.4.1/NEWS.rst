0.1.4.1
-------------------

Fixes
+++++++++++++
* Adjust `kmax` parameter in `fractal_higuchi()` according to signal length as having `kmax` more than half of signal length leads to division by zero error
* Ensure that sanitization of input in `_hrv_dfa()` is done before windows for `DFA_alpha2` is computed
* `np.seterr` is added to `fractal_dfa()` to avoid returning division by zero warning which is an expected behaviour


0.1.4
-------------------

Breaking Changes
+++++++++++++++++

* `fractal_df()` now returns a dictionary of windows, fluctuations and the slope value (see documentation for more information. If `multifractal` is True, the dictionary additionally contains the parameters of the singularity spectrum (see `singularity_spectrum()` for more information)

New Features
+++++++++++++

* Add convenience function `intervals_to_peaks()` useful for RRI or BBI conversion to peak indices
* `hrv_nonlinear()` and `rrv_rsp()` now return the parameters of singularity spectrum for multifractal DFA analysis
* Add new complexity measures in `fractal_higuchi()`, `fractal_katz()` and `fractal_lempelziv()`
* Add new time-domain measures in `hrv_time()`: `SDANN` and `SDNNI`
* Add new non-linear measures in `hrv_nonlinear()`: `ShanEn`, `FuzzyEn`, `HFD`, `KFD` and `LZC`

Fixes
+++++++++++++

* Add path argument in `mne_data()` and throw warning to download mne datasets if data folder is not present
* The implementation of `TTIN` in `hrv_time()` is amended to its correct formulation.
* The default binsize used for RRI histogram in the computation of geometric HRV indices is set to 1 / 128 seconds


0.1.3
-------------------

Breaking Changes
+++++++++++++++++

* None

New Features
+++++++++++++

* Add internal function for detecting missing data points and forward filling missing values in `nk.*_clean()` functions
* Add computation of standard deviation in `eventrelated()` functions for *ECG_Rate_SD*, *EMG_Amplitude_SD*, *EOG_Rate_SD*, *PPG_Rate_SD*, *RSP_Rate_SD*, *RSP_Amplitude_SD*
* Add labelling for interval related features if a dictionary of dataframes is passed
* Retrun Q peaks and S Peaks information for wavelet-based methods in `nk.ecg_delineate()`

Fixes
+++++++++++++

* Fix epochs columns with `dtype: object` generated by `nk.epochs_create()`
* Bug fix ecg_findpeaks_rodrigues for array out of bounds bug


0.1.2
-------------------

New Features
+++++++++++++

* Additional features for `nk.rsp_intervalrelated()`: average inspiratory and expiratory durations, inspiratory-to-expiratory (I/E) time ratio
* Add multiscale entropy measures (MSE, CMSE, RCMSE) and fractal methods (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Correlation Dimension) into `nk.hrv_nonlinear()`
* Allow for data resampling in `nk.read_bitalino()`
* Add `bio_resting_8min_200hz` into database for reading with `nk.data()`
* Reading of url links in `nk.data()`
* Allow for `nk.hrv()` to compute RSA indices if respiratory data is present
* All `hrv` functions to automatically detect correct sampling rate if tuple or dict is passed as input
* Add support for PPG analysis: `nk.ppg_eventrelated()`, `nk.ppg_intervalrelated()`, `nk.ppg_analyze()`
* Add Zhao et al. (2018) method for `nk.ecg_quality()`
* Add tests for `epochs` module
* Add sub-epoch option for ECG and RSP event-related analysis:
	* users can create a smaller sub-epoch within the event-related epoch
	* the rate-related features of ECG and RSP signals are calculated over the sub-epoch
	* the remaining features are calculated over the original epoch, not the sub-epoch

Fixes
+++++++++++++

* Fix propagation of values in `nk.signal_formatpeaks()` for formatting SCR column outputs generated by `eda_peaks()`
* Fix docstrings of `nk.rsp_phase()`, from "RSP_Inspiration" to "RSP_Phase"
* Update `signal_filter()` method for `rsp_clean()`: to use `sos` form, instead of `ba` form of butterworth (similar to `eda_clean()`)





0.1.1
-------------------

New Features
+++++++++++++

* Use duration from `nk.events_find()` as `epochs_end` in `nk.epochs_create()`
* Allow customized subsets of epoch lengths in `nk.bio_analyze()` with `window_lengths` argument
* Add `nk.find_outliers()` to identify outliers (abnormal values)
* Add utility function - `nk.check_type()` to return appropriate boolean values of input (integer, list, ndarray, pandas dataframe or pandas series)
* (experimental) Add error bars in the summary plot method to illustrate standard error of each bin


Fixes
+++++++++++++

* Fix type of value in `nk.signal_formatpeaks()` to ensure slice assignment is done on the same type


0.0.1 (2019-10-29)
-------------------

* First release on PyPI.
