Description: DataKund Scraper is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from any HTML page. You don't have to inspect any web elements to find tags, xpath id etc.
        It learns from the data given by you & builds a scraper. Then you can use it to get JSON data out of the HTML.
        
        
        ### Run Scraper
        We run scraper by passing url. This gives us JSON data in return.
        ```sh
        from datakund_scraper import *
        link='https://pypi.org/search/?q=firebase'
        response=scraper.scrape(url=link)
        #response={"Results":[{"title":"","link":""},...]}
        ```
