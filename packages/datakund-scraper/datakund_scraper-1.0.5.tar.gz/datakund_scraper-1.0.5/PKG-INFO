Description: DataKund Scraper is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from any HTML page. You don't have to inspect any web elements to find tags, xpath id etc.
        It learns from the data given by you & builds a scraper. Then you can use it to get JSON data out of the HTML.
        
        ### Train Scraper
        We train scraper by passing html of 2 similar pages for eg. page 1 & page 2 of search results. This gives us a unique id. That id can be used for runing the scraper and fetching our data.
        You can save this id to run the scraper next time, so that you don't need to train the scraper everytime for that type of page.
        ```sh
        from datakund_scraper import *
        html1='<html>.....</html>'
        html2='<html>.....</html>'
        response=scraper.train(html1,html2)
        #response={"id":"esfdesd342","success":True}
        ```
        
        ### Run Scraper
        We run scraper by passing html and scraper id which we fetched earlier. This gives us JSON data in return.
        ```sh
        from datakund_scraper import *
        html1='<html>.....</html>'
        response=scraper.run(html=html1,id="esfdesd342")
        #response={"Results":[{"title":"","link":""},...]}
        ```
        
        ### What are similiar HTMLs?
        Similiar pages are those which look same on the UI but with different data. 
        Once the scraper is trained, then can use it to fetch data from all similar pages
        
        Below are some of the examples of pages using which you can run autoscraper:-
        1. Pypi Search Results [https://pypi.org/search/?q=firebase,https://pypi.org/search/?q=sql]
