# Comparative and causal analyis 

The **comps** package is used to select look alike groups for comparative
analysis and experimental design.

The comps package helps one easily mimic sample groups drawn from a specific
population and find the closest individual matches within a population or
sample set. These two approaches, 1) matching or balancing groups and 2)
matching individual observations are frequently used in isolation and in tandem
for comparative observational studies and experimental design. It's extremely
helpful, therefore, to have a package that allows you to conveniently move
between the approaches or combine them in fluid manner.
