
stpredict package
=================

stpredict is designed to apply forecasting methods on spatio-temporal data to predict the values of a target variable in the future time points based on the historical values of the data features. The main stages of the modeling process are implemented in this package including:

- Data preprocessing
- Data partitioning
- Feature selection
- Model selection
- Model evaluation
- Prediction
