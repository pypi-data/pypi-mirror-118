Description: # Quru in one sentence
        Quru is a python workflow framework to easily swarm up a bunch of workers to streamly process tasks.
        
        # What "Quru" means?
        Quru (Chinese 瞿如, pronounce keeru) is a bird-like beast with human face and three feet, initially described in Shan Hai Jing, a classic book that describes mythic geography and beasts.
