Description: # datasette-surveys
        
        Construct and gather responses to surveys all within Datasette!
        
        ![Here's what the survey form builder looks like](https://github.com/next-LI/datasette-surveys/blob/main/screenshot.png)
        
        
        This plugin is based heavily on the officially amazing but unsupported [Alpaca form builder](http://www.alpacajs.org/demos/form-builder/form-builder.html).
        
        ## Installation
        
            python setup.py install
        
        ## Usage
        
        The plugin adds an interface at `/-/surveys` and a "Surveys" link in the menu.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        This plugin uses the permission plugin looking for responses to the following actions (they all start with `surveys-`):
        
        - `surveys-list`: allows actors to view the list of previously created surveys.
        - `surveys-create`: allows actors to create surveys. Won't allow overwriting by itself.
        - `surveys-update`: allows actors to update surveys, _resource_: id of the survey if being updated. This permission doesn't stop actors from updating with blank surveys or otherwise removing fields.
        - `surveys-delete`: allows actors to delete surveys. _resource_: id of the survey being deleted.
        - `surveys-view-form`: allows actors to view and respond to individual forms. _resource_: id of the survey.
        
        ## Development
        
        The form builder borrows heavily from [Alpaca's form builder](http://www.alpacajs.org/demos/form-builder/form-builder.html) and the front end build also comes from the Alpaca repo.
        
        To pull the dependencies for the plugin, use bower:
        
            bower install
        
        And if you don't have bower, run this first: `npm install -g bower`
        
        The form builder is found in `datasette_surveys/static/form-builder.js`. It's a modified version of the Alpaca one.
        
        Running `python setup.py install` will reinstall the plugin.
