            if the neural network is an instance of abcpy.NN_utilities.networks.DefaultNN with some input and
            output size, then you should provide here the input size of the network. It has to be provided together with

            the hidden sizes are determined from the input and output sizes as determined in

            composition of two Statistics, you can pass the first here; then, whenever the final statistic is needed, it
            is sufficient to call the `statistics` method of the second one, and that will automatically apply both
            transformations. In this case, this is the statistics that has to be computed before the neural network
            transformation is applied.
        Returns
        -------
        abcpy.statistics.NeuralEmbedding
            the `NeuralEmbedding` object with the neural network obtained from the specified file.
