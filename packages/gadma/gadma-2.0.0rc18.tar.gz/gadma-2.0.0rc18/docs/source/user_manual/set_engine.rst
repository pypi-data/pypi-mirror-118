Specifying an engine
=======================

.. admonition:: Related options

    * **Base options**:

      * ``Engine`` indicates what engine will be used for demographic inference.

    * **Additional options**:

      * ``Pts`` - grid sizes for ``dadi`` engine.

GADMA provides the following choice of engines for demographic inference:

    - ``dadi``
    - ``moments`` (by default)
    - ``momi``

In order to choose engine:

.. code-block:: none

   # param file
   ...
   Engine : moments
   ...

dadi
-----------

``dadi`` engine (Diffusion Approximation for Demographic Inference) was presented in [Gutenkunst2009]_ and has been developed since then. ``dadi`` engine is able to infer inbreeding coefficients ([Blischak2020]_).

When using the ``dadi`` engine, it is recommended to check the value of the ``Pts`` option in the ``params_file``. ``Pts`` is a sequence of three numbers, each of which is equal to the number of points in grid size. The greater the numbers are, the more accurate numerical solution of a partial differential equation ``dadi`` will give. However, finding such a more accurate solution takes more time. By default, GADMA takes ``Pts : n, n + 10, n + 20``, where ``n`` is the largest sample size among the populations of interest.

.. code-block:: none

    # param file
    ...
    Engine : dadi
    Pts: [40, 50, 60]
    ...

.. note:: ``Pts`` option is also used for other engines as well: for generation of python code for ``dadi``. So if one wants to use ``dadi``'s code of final models after run then maybe the ``Pts`` argument must be set too.

moments
---------

``moments`` engine [Jouganous2017] is very similar to ``dadi``. Usually it is much faster than ``dadi`` but maybe less accurate. It is the default engine for demographic inference with GADMA.

.. code-block:: none

    # param file
    ...
    Engine : moments
    ...

``moments`` engine is able to draw plots of demographic models. Be default ``demes`` engine is used as an engine for drawing but ``moments`` can be also chosen. For more information please see `Plotting model <plotting.rst>`__ section.

momi
-----

Another engine for demographic inference is ``momi``. Although GADMA is limited to three populations with a demographic model with structure, ``momi`` and therefore the ``momi`` engine can be used for a lot of populations (e.g. 10) with a custom demographic model.

Custom demographic model given to GADMA will be read in a different way than models for ``dadi`` and ``moments``. The units of parameters are assumed to be in physical units. To mark that some parameter is in genetic units please add `_gen` to its name (e.g. `nu_gen`). `The example of usage of ``momi`` engine with custom demographic model `example <https://gadma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/custom_model_example_momi.html>`_.

Engines ``dadi`` and ``moments`` have a special type of demographic inference that is called multinomial inference: it is possible to infer size of ancestral population implicitly from values of other parameters. However, ``momi`` engine is not able to perform such inference and option ``Ancestral size as parameter`` should be set to ``True``.

Unfortunately, ``momi`` engine has some limitations on demographic parameters: it does not infer continuous migrations and linear size change. If an engine is chosen then GADMA informs about these limitations and disables migration and linear dynamic automatically.

.. code-block:: none

    # param file
    ...
    Engine : momi
    # the following options are set automatically if momi engine is chosen
    Ancestral size as parameter: True
    No migrations: True
    Dynamics: [Sud, Exp]
    ...

``momi`` engine can be also used to draw demographic models, however, it fails to draw histories with linear size change and does not draw migrations. For more information please see `Plotting model <plotting.rst>`__ section.
