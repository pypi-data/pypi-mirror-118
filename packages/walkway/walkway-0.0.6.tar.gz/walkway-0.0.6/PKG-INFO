Description: # Walkway - motion detector
        
        Capture high-framerate videos of a custom-made, CatWalk-like setup for mice using FLIR's BlackFly cameras.
        A video is saved to disk every time motion is detected.
        
        ## Installation
        * Install [SpinView (Latest Spinnaker Web Installer)][SpinView]
        * Install [Python version 3.8][Python38]
        * Open `cmd`
        * Run `pip install walkway` or `python -m pip install walkway`.
        
        ## Usage overview
        * Power on IR ligth source.
        * Plug in camera to computer.
        * Setup camera using SpinView, if necessary:
        	- Start acquisition.
        	- Adjust camera aperture and focus to view region of interest under the light conditions expected during the experiment.
        	- Adjust image format to limit the view to the apparatus' walkway.
        	- Stop acquisition.
        * Open `cmd`
        * Run `python -m walkway.capture`
        * Press `q` on the GUI or `ctrl+c` on the command window when done.
        * Video files are saved to cmd's working directory (defaults to `C:/Users/<your username>` in Windows). You may `cd` to a different directory prior to start capturing to save videos elsewhere.
        
        
        ## Version History
        * 0.0.4: Add argument parser and configuration file.
        * 0.0.1: Initial release. Scripts are multi-threaded so as to not lag during writing operations to disk.
