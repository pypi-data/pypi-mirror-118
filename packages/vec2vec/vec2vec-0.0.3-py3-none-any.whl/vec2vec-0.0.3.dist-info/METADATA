# vec2vec

This repository provides a reference implementation of vec2vec, which can reduce the dimension to matrix.


### Requirements
Before starting this project, you must install requirements below.

```
faiss==1.7.0
gensim==4.0.1
networkx==2.6.2
scikit-learn==0.24.2
```

Note：It's recommended that using conda to install faiss, and conda version need to update.

```
conda install faiss-cpu -c conda-forge
```

### Basic Usage

1. To run *vec2vec*  by terminal, execute the following command from the project home directory:
   ```
   python ./vec2vec/main.py --input ./vec2vec/data/train.bow
   ```

   You can check out the other options available by using:
   ```
   python ./vec2vec/main.py  --help
   ```

2. To run the vec2vec in your project, execute the following command:

   ```
   pip install vec2vec
   ```

### Input
Refer to the ./vec2vec/data/train.bow in the project.

### Output
The output are like below:
