# AutoTrader
AutoTrader is an event-driven platform intended to help in the development, optimisation and live deployment of automated trading systems. 
A basic level of experience with Python is recommended for using AutoTrader, but the [website](https://kieran-mackle.github.io/AutoTrader) 
aims to make using it as easy as possible with detailed tutorials.

## Documentation
AutoTrader is well documented on the [project website](https://kieran-mackle.github.io/AutoTrader/docs).

## Demo Chart
The chart below is produced by a backtest of a MACD strategy. Note that stop loss and take profit levels are shown for each trade taken. 
This allows you to see how effective your exit strategy is - are you being stopped out too early by placing your stop losses too tight? 
Are you missing out on otherwise profitable trades becuase your take profits are too far away? AutoTrader helps you visualise your strategy
and answer these questions.
