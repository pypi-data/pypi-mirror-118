Description: # Neutron Sync CLI Client
        
        ## Introduction
        
        Neutron Sync is a synchronization tool that helps you synchronize your small configuration files often referred to as dot files. Since these files are often sensitive and contain things such as encryption keys and passwords, files are encrypted before being stored remotely. Only you own the key that can decrypt the files. Additionally, if you use the default www.neutronsync.com remote store, then files are encrypted again at rest. Thus files are encrypted twice for extra security.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        sudo -i
        pip3 install nsync-cli
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### One Time Setup
        
        ```
        nsync login
        nsync keygen
        ```
        
        **!!!Note!!!** Be sure to keep `.config/nsync/config.json` safe. This file has your encryption key without it you can not decrypt your files.
        
        ### Everyday Usage
        
        Add new files to sync: `nsync add path/to/file`
        
        Pull files that need to be updated: `nsync pull`
        
        The `add` command supports file globs like `.ssh/*` and `./ssh/**/*` with the second example being recursive.
        
        Coming Soon: Push updated files `nsync push`
        
        ## Limitation
        
        - Files synced are assumed to be small configuration files. Larger files (>1mb) may choke or slow down sync processes.
        - The client only supports a limit of 500 files to sync right now.

        ## Running Your Own Server
        
        To use your own server update your config file, replace the `server_url` value: `"server_url": "https://www.neutronsync.com"`. Your config file is located at `~/.config/nsync/config.json`
        
        See the [Neutron Server](https://github.com/neutron-sync/nsync-server) project for information on how to host your own server.
