## Overview
1. Install python (Windows or debian)
2. Install connecty
3. Setup and run connecty
## Install python on Windows
#### Install Python
Get the installer [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Although you installed python, you will not run python directly, but use the cmd/terminal/powershell

#### Configure Alias
Open a terminal as administrator and run this command (This is the only step where you'll need administrator)
```
(echo python %*) > C:/Windows/python3.bat
```
If this step fails for whatever reason, you may still continue on, but you need to replace `python3` with `python`
## Install python on Debian
Get python 3 through your package manager
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```
## Install Connecty
Install connecty
```
python3 -m pip install connecty
```

## Setup
### Create a config file
Save a new text file with your config. You can save it anywhere on your computer.
The file must be in the .ini format and contain your token and all your connections.
 ```ini
[BOT]
token = tokengoeshere

[my_connection_1]
channels = 123456789 123456789 123456789

[my_connection_2]
channels = 123456789 123456789 123456789
```
The first section should be called `[BOT]` and contain your token.
Each subsequent section is a different connection.
The exact name doesn't matter so name them something memorable.

### Run the bot
Run this command in cmd/terminal (installing connecty added the `connecty` command)
 ```
python3 -m connecty path/to/config.ini
 ```
