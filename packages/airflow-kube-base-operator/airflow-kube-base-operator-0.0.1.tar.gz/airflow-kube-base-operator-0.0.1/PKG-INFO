Description: # Airflow Kubernetes Base Operator
        
        ## What is this?
        This should be a generic operator for other airflow k**o to use as their core dependency. 
        Maybe you'll find some use in the python kube api wrapper, otherwise probably the specific package for your needs will be better.
        
        ## Note
