# nv.nfe
Simple XML parser for reading standard Brazilian digital invoices (NFe)

## Disclaimers
This library is a "quick and dirt" reader for Brazilian NFe (Nota Fiscal Eletr√¥nica).  The package itself is based on 
a simple xml serializer and parser built on top of xmltodict.  **This has NOT been
tested under for xml vulnerabilities** and will probably never will, as it was develped as an internal parser for data analysis.
