# gauss_binom_distributions_for_ds

gauss_binom_distributions_for_ds is a python package that brings to you two distributions: Gaussian and Binomial.

With these distribution classes, you can instantiate them with their required values (mean and stdenv for gaussian and n and p for binomial) and can do operations like:

- plot its histogram
- update their inner values
- compute the probability density function (pdf)
- plot its pdf
- sum between distributions
