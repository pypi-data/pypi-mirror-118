Description: # Conduits - A Declarative Pipelining Tool For Pandas
        Traditional tools for declaring pipelines in Python suck. They are mostly 
        imperative, and can sometimes requires that you adhere to strong contracts in
        order to use them (looking at you Scikit Learn pipelines ��). It is also 
        usually done completely differently to the way the pipelines where developed 
        during the ideation phase, requiring significate rewrite to get them to work
        in the new paradigm.
        
        Modelled off the declarative pipeline of Flask, **Tether** aims to give you a
        nicer, simpler, and more flexible way of declaring your data processing pipelines.
