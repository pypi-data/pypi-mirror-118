Description: # project_structure_pypi
        
        A package created solely for teaching (and maybe entertainment) reasons.
        
        It has a package with two modules, scraper and date. 
        
        `scraper` looks for a date in wikipedia and extracts the celebrities that were born that day
        
        `date` has a `Date` class that displayes the date, and has a method `to_wiki_format` so the wikipedia URL can read it
        
        Thus, both classes can work together, first to ask for a date, then it translate it to something readable by the wikipedia URL, and then scrape the necessary data.
