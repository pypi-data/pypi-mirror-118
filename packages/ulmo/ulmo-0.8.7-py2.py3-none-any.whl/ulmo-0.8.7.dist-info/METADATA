        :alt: Documentation Status


Features
--------

- retrieves and parses datasets from the web
- returns simple python data structures that can be easily pulled into more
  sophisticated tools such as Pandas for analysis
- caches datasets locally and harvests updates as needed


Datasets
--------

Currently, ulmo supports the following datasets / services:

- California Department of Water Resources Historical Data
- Climate Prediction Center Weekly Drought
- CUAHSI WaterOneFlow
- Lower Colorado River Authority Hydromet and Water Quality Data
- NASA Daymet weather data
- National Climatic Data Center Climate Index Reference Sequential (CIRS)
- National Climatic Data Center Global Historical Climate Network Daily
- National Climatic Data Center Global Summary of the Day
- Texas Weather Connection Daily Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI)
- US Army Corps of Engineers - Tulsa District Water Control
- USGS National Water Information System
- USGS Emergency Data Distribution Network services
- USGS Earth Resources Observation Systems (EROS) services
- USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) services


Installation
------------

Ulmo depends on a lot of libraries from the scientific python stack (namely:
numpy, pytables and pandas) and lxml. There are a couple of ways to get these
dependencies installed but it can be tricky if doing it by hand. The simplest
way to get things up and running is to use a scientific python distribution that
will install everything together. A full list is available on the `scipy`_
website but `Anaconda`_ / `Miniconda`_ is recommended as it is the easiest to set up.

If you are using Anaconda/Miniconda then you can install ulmo from the `conda-forge`_
channel with the following command:

    conda install -c conda-forge ulmo

Otherwise, follow the instructions below:

Once the requisite scientific python libraries are installed, the
most recent release of ulmo can be installed from PyPI using ``pip``:

    pip install ulmo

To install the bleeding edge development version, grab a copy of the `source
code`_ and run setup.py from the root directory:

To setup a development environment using conda:

    conda env create -n myenv --file conda_environment.yml

    # use 'activate myenv' on windows

    source activate myenv

    pip install -e .
