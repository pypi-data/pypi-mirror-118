Ulmo depends on a lot of libraries from the scientific python stack (namely:
numpy, pytables and pandas) and lxml. There are a couple of ways to get these
dependencies installed but it can be tricky if doing it by hand. The simplest
way to get things up and running is to use a scientific python distribution that
will install everything together. A full list is available on the `scipy`_
website but `Anaconda`_ / `Miniconda`_ is recommended as it is the easiest to set up.

If you are using Anaconda/Miniconda then you can install ulmo from the `conda-forge`_
channel with the following command:

    conda install -c conda-forge ulmo

Otherwise, follow the instructions below:

Once the requisite scientific python libraries are installed, the
most recent release of ulmo can be installed from PyPI using ``pip``:

    pip install ulmo

To install the bleeding edge development version, grab a copy of the `source
code`_ and run setup.py from the root directory:

To setup a development environment using conda:

    conda env create -n myenv --file conda_environment.yml

    # use 'activate myenv' on windows

    source activate myenv

    pip install -e .
