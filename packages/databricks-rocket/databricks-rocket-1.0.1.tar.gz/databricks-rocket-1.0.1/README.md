Keep your local python scripts installed and in sync with a databricks notebook.
Every change on your local machine is automatically applied to the notebook.
Shortens the feedback loop to develop git based projects.
Removes the need to setup a local development environment.

Find installation instructions [here](docs/installation.md).


## Using


To deploy any python project *with a setup.py*

```sh
# enter the project you want to install in the notebook and run the following command
rocket trigger . dbfs:/temp/your_name --watch=True
# you can you any path here but we recommend namespacing it with your name
```

This command will return the exact command you have to perform in your notebook next:

Create a cell in the top of the notebook and paste the content (example below)

```sh
%pip install /dbfs/temp/your_folder/your-package0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl  --force-reinstall --no-deps
```

## Support

- Databricks: 7 (recommended), 6.4 (supported but requires cleaning the notebook state)
- Python: >=3.7
- Tested on Platform: Linux, MacOs. Windows will probably not work but contributions are welcomed!
