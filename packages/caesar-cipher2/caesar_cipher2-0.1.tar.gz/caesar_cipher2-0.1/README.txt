# Dictionary is important for this package, if you want to use your own dictionary
# make sure to add 26 key-value pairs just in case the program doesn't crash

# to understand this code better, just remember that to encode a message you must sort-
                                                                               *        *      *       
# -the characters in the values of the dictionary in alphabetical order; {'c':'a', 'e':'b', g:'c'} and so on
# to decode the message just reverse the dictionary, the characters in the keys of the dictionary must be sorted
# in alphabetical order
