Depoverflow
-----------

This tool checks your source code for references to Stackoverflow answers and GitHub issues and warns you if those change.

Why?
----

There are plenty of tools that will let you know if your package dependencies have changed (`poetry show -o`, `npm outdated`, ...). There are even cloud-based services like Dependabot.

However, if you copy/paste code from Stackoverflow answers or GitHub issues, you will never be notified of updates.

Features
--------

* Find references to Stackoverflow answers and questions in code comments, to alert of edits and/or comments
* Find references to GitHub issues in code comments, to alert of open and close events and/or comments
* Optionally supports specific keywords such as "Works around"
* Saves current status of referenced items in a TOML file (similar to a lockfile), that you can check into version control (or not)

How to use
----------

Install the tool: `pip install depoverflow`

Create a configuration file `depoverflow.toml` with the list of source file patterns you want to read (in [Python glob format](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob)):

```toml
sources = [
    "src/**.py",
    "tests.py",
    "native/*.c",
]
```

Run the tool: `depoverflow`.

A file `depoverflow.status` will be created, which you can check into version control or not. It is a TOML file containing the current status of the items you reference from your code, so that a warning can be shown the next time they change.
