# EnphaseEnergy

Various collected information about Enphase Energy solar system (I am just starting on this oneâ€¦ But the installer password was highly requested on the web, so I am starting with that one)

- [passwordCalc.py](passwordCalc.py) - sample code to calculate the installer password for a given serial number
- [findEnphaseWithBonjour.py](findEnphaseWithBonjour.py) - sample code to find Enphase Envoy via Bonjour/Zeroconf. This also provides the serial number of the Envoy.
- [enphaseStreamMeter.py](enphaseStreamMeter.py) - sample code to stream production/consumption. Requires the installer password.
