It is possible to create a desktop link, or a start menu link. Execute the command above with `--desktop-shortcut`
or `--startmenu-shortcut` option

**Note**: On Linux must be `/home/user/.local/bin` in PATH and on Windows must be `PythonInstallationDirectory\Scripts`
in PATH.

### Linux

#### Arch based

There are some AUR packages available:

- [rare](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rare) - for stable releases
- [rare-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rare-git) - for the latest features, which are not in a stable release

available

### Run from source

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get dependencies. If you use `pacman` you can
   run `sudo pacman --needed -S python-wheel python-setuptools python-pyqt5 python-qtawesome python-requests python-pillow`
