Note: The order identifier passed into this field must be an Order ID in the new format.

These date filters use the ISO-8601 24-hour date and time format, and time zone used is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu. The open_date_from field sets the beginning date of the date range, and can be set as far back as 18 months from the present time.

These date filters use the ISO-8601 24-hour date and time format, and the time zone used is Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu. The open_date_to field sets the ending date of the date range, and can be set up to 90 days from the date set in the open_date_from field. The ISO-8601 format looks like this: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm.ss.sssZ. An example would be 2019-08-04T19:09:02.768Z.
        :param str payment_dispute_status: This filter is used if the seller wishes to only retrieve payment disputes in a specific state. More than one value can be specified. If no payment_dispute_status filter is used, payment disputes in all states are returned in the response. See DisputeStateEnum type for supported values.
        :param str limit: The value passed in this query parameter sets the maximum number of payment disputes to return per page of data. The value passed in this field should be an integer from 1 to 200. If this query parameter is not set, up to 200 records will be returned on each page of results. Min: 1; Max: 200; Default: 200
        :param str offset: This field is used to specify the number of records to skip in the result set before returning the first payment dispute in the paginated response. A zero-based index is used, so if you set the offset value to 0 (default value), the first payment dispute in the result set appears at the top of the response. Combine offset with the limit parameter to control the payment disputes returned in the response. For example, if you supply an offset value of 0 and a limit value of 10, the response will contain the first 10 payment disputes from the result set that matches the input criteria. If you supply an offset value of 10 and a limit value of 20, the response will contain payment disputes 11-30 from the result set that matches the input criteria. Min: 0; Max: total number of payment disputes - 1; Default: 0
