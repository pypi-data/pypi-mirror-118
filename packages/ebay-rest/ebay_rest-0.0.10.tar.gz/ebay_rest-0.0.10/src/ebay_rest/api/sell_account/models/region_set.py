        A list of one or more regionsName fields that specify the areas to where a seller does not ship. Populate regionExcluded in only the top-level shipToLocations container (do not populate this field within the shippingOptions container). Normally a seller ships to as many areas as possible using both DOMESTIC and INTERNATIONAL shipping options and they don't have a need to exclude any regions from their ship-to locations. With this, there's no reason to set regionExclude fields. However, it makes sense to set the regionExcluded field when a seller wants to exclude a small area that's located within a larger area they service. For example, suppose a seller indicates they ship 'Worldwide', but for some reason must exclude a specific country, or world region, from the larger world area they ship to. To retrieve the regions you can specify in the associated regionName field, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ExcludeShippingLocationDetails, then review the Location fields in the response for the strings that you can specify regionExcluded.regionName. Note that if a buyer's primary ship-to location is a region that a seller has excluded in their fulfillment policy (or if the buyer does not have a primary ship-to location), they will receive an error message if they attempt to buy or place a bid on an item that uses that fulfillment policy.
