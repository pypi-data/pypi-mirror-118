Use this parameter in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves monetary transactions 11 thru 20 from the result set. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. If an orderId, transactionId, or payoutId filter is included in the request, any limit value will be ignored. Maximum: 1000 Default: 20
        :param str offset: This integer value indicates the actual position that the first monetary transaction returned on the current page has in the results set. So, if you wanted to view the 11th monetary transaction of the result set, you would set the offset value in the request to 10. In the request, you can use the offset parameter in conjunction with the limit parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 30 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves transactions 31 thru 40 from the resulting collection of transactions.

Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by transaction status: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionStatus:{PAYOUT} buyerUsername: the eBay user ID of the buyer involved in the monetary transaction. Only monetary transactions involving this buyer are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific eBay buyer: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=buyerUsername:{buyer1234} salesRecordReference: the unique Selling Manager identifier of the order involved in the monetary transaction. Only monetary transactions involving this Selling Manager Sales Record ID are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific Selling Manager Sales Record ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=salesRecordReference:{123} Note: For all orders originating after February 1, 2020, a value of 0 will be returned in the salesRecordReference field. So, this filter will only be useful to retrieve orders than occurred before this date. payoutId: the unique identifier of a seller payout. This value is auto-generated by eBay once the seller payout is set to be processed. Only monetary transactions involving this Payout ID are returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific Payout ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=payoutId:{5000106638} transactionId: the unique identifier of a monetary transaction. For a sales order, the orderId filter should be used instead. Only the monetary transaction defined by the identifier is returned. Note: This filter cannot be used alone; the transactionType must also be specified when filtering by transaction ID. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific transaction ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=transactionId:{03-03620-33763}&amp;filter=transactionType:{SALE} orderId: the unique identifier of a sales order. For any other monetary transaction, the transactionId filter should be used instead. Only the sales order defined by the identifier is returned. Below is the proper syntax to use if filtering by a specific order ID: https://apiz.ebay.com/sell/finances/v1/transaction?filter=orderId:{03-03620-33763} For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/finances/types/cos:FilterField
        :param str sort: Sorting is not yet available for the getTransactions method. By default, monetary transactions that match the input criteria are sorted in descending order according to the transaction date. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/finances/types/cos:SortField
        :param str limit: The number of monetary transactions to return per page of the result set. Use this parameter in conjunction with the offset parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 10 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves monetary transactions 11 thru 20 from the result set. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. If an orderId, transactionId, or payoutId filter is included in the request, any limit value will be ignored. Maximum: 1000 Default: 20
        :param str offset: This integer value indicates the actual position that the first monetary transaction returned on the current page has in the results set. So, if you wanted to view the 11th monetary transaction of the result set, you would set the offset value in the request to 10. In the request, you can use the offset parameter in conjunction with the limit parameter to control the pagination of the output. For example, if offset is set to 30 and limit is set to 10, the method retrieves transactions 31 thru 40 from the resulting collection of transactions. Note: This feature employs a zero-based list, where the first item in the list has an offset of 0. Default: 0 (zero)
        :return: Transactions
                 If the method is called asynchronously,
                 returns the request thread.
