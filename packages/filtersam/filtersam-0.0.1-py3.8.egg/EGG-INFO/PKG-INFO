# Filter SAM/BAM file by percent identity or percent of matched sequence


# TODO

1. Perhaps good idea (if possible) to add a specific tag to BAM/SAM containing computed percent identity
2. Include several definitions of percent identity and/or let the user define one
3. Make it a command line callable as well
