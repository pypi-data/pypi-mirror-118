# Python SDK for NewsCatcher News API

Official Python client library to manipulate NewsCatcher News API V2 from your Python application.

Documentation is identical with the API documentation. The same parameters and filters are available. 
And the same response structure. You can have a look at [docs.newscatcherapi.com](https://docs.newscatcherapi.com/).

## Authentication

The Authentication is done via the `x_api_key` variable.

Receive your API key by registering at [app.newscatcherapi.com](https://app.newscatcherapi.com/).

## Installation
```pip install newscatcherapi```

## Quick Start
Import installed package.

`````from newscatcherapi import NewsCatcherApiClient`````

Init the instance with an API key given after registration.

````newscatcherapi = NewsCatcherApiClient(x_api_key='YOUR_API_KEY') ````

## Endpoints
An instance of `NewsCatcherApiClient` has three main methods that correspond to three endpoints available for NewsCatcher News API.

### Get News (/v2/search)
Main method that allows you to find news article by keyword, date, language, country, etc.

```
all_articles = newscatcherapi.get_search(q='Elon Musk',
                                         lang='en',
                                         country='CA',
                                         page_size=100)
```

### Get Latest Headlines (/v2/latest_headlines)
Get the latest headlines given any topic, country, sources, or language.

```
top_headlines = newscatcherapi.get_latest_headlines(lang='en',
                                                    countries='us',
                                                    topic='business')
 ```

### Get Sources (/v2/sources)
Returns a list of the top 100 supported news websites. Overall, we support over 60,000 websites. Using this method, you may find the top 100 for your specific language, country, topic combination.

```
sources = newscatcherapi.get_sources(topic='business',
                                     lang='en',
                                     countries='US')
 ```


### Use *from_* and *to_* instead of *from* and *to* like in NewsCatcher News API
In Python, we are not allowed to reserve variable names *from* and *to*. If you try to use them, you will get a syntax error:

```SyntaxError: invalid syntax``` 

So, here is an example on how to use time variables *from_* and *to_* in *get_search* method.

```
all_articles = newscatcherapi.get_search(q='Elon Musk',
                                         lang='en',
                                         countries='CA,US',
                                         from_='2021/08/20',
                                         to_='2021/08/31')
```
