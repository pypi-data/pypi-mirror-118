Description: ## TSCoDe: Transition State Conformational Docker.
        Systematically generate poses for bimolecular and trimolecular transition states. Support for open and cyclical transition states, exploring all regiosomeric and stereoisomeric poses.
        
        ## TSCoDe Changelog
        
        ### 0.0.1 (10 Aug 2021)
        - First release
        
        ### 0.0.2 (10 Aug 2021)
        - If pivots decrease during a bend, an exception is raised. Future versions might have a different behavior in this scenario.
        
        ### 0.0.3 (10 Aug 2021)
        - setup.py bugfixes.
        
        ### 0.0.5 (1 Sep 2021)
        - SADDLE keyword implementation.
        - Added keywords print at top of log
        - Pairings are now of two types: reactive atoms (a, b, c) or NCIs (x, y, z). The latter are adjusted when specifying distances with DIST but are left free to reach their equilibrium distance (HalfSpring constraint + additional relax).
        - Major code cleaning, refactoring and reordering
        - Added solvent support for calculators (SOLVENT keyword)
        - Dihedral embeds now support both the SADDLE and NEB keywords
        - Similar structures are now pruned in a rational way: the best looking is kept (fast_score)
