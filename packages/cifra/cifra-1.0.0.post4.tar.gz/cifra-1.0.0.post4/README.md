# SYNOPSIS

**cifra** â€” Library and console command to crypt and decrypt texts using classic methods.

# DESCRIPTION
**cifra** is a console command and a python library to cipher and decipher texts
using classic methods. It also performs cryptoattacks against those methods.

I've implemented this while I read Al Sweigart's *"Cracking Codes with Python"*.

# USAGE

`$ cifra MODE [-h | --help ]`

# MODES

## Dictionary
Manage dictionaries to perform crypto attacks.

`$ cifra dictionary ACTION`

### Possible actions:

#### create
Create a dictionary of unique words.

    $ cifra dictionary create NEW_DICTIONARY_NAME

##### positional arguments:
    NEW_DICTIONARY_NAME   Name for the dictionary to create.

##### optional arguments:
    -i PATH_TO FILE_WITH_WORDS | --initial_words_file PATH_TO FILE_WITH_WORDS
                        Optionally you can load in the dictionary words
                        located in a file. File can be a regular text file, like 
                        a book. Redundant words are ignored by ingestion process.

#### delete
Remove an existing dictionary.

    $ cifra dictionary delete DICTIONARY_NAME_TO_DELETE

##### positional arguments:
    DICTIONARY_NAME_TO_DELETE  Name for the dictionary to delete.

#### update
Add words to an existing dictionary.

    $ cifra dictionary update DICTIONARY_NAME_TO_UPDATE PATH_TO_FILE_WITH_WORDS

##### positional arguments:
    DICTIONARY_NAME_TO_UPDATE  Name for the dictionary to update with additional words.
    
    PATH_TO_FILE_WITH_WORDS  Pathname to a file with words to add to dictionary. File can be a regular text file, like 
                        a book. Redundant words are ignored by ingestion process.


#### list
Show existing dictionaries.

    $ cifra dictionary list

## Cipher
Cipher a text using a key.

`$ cifra cipher ALGORITHM_NAME CIPHERING_KEY FILE_TO_CIPHER`

##### positional arguments:
    ALGORITHM_NAME        Algorithm to use to cipher.
    CIPHERING_KEY         Key to use to cipher.
    FILE_TO_CIPHER        Path to file with text to cipher.

##### optional arguments:
     -o OUTPUT_CIPHERED_FILE, --ciphered_file OUTPUT_CIPHERED_FILE
                        Path to output file to place ciphered text. If not
                        used then ciphered text will be dumped to console.
     -c CHARSET, --charset CHARSET
                        Default charset is: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefgh
                        ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890 !?., but you can set here
                        another.


## Decipher
Decipher a text using a key.

`$ cifra decipher ALGORITHM_NAME CIPHERING_KEY FILE_TO_DECIPHER`

##### positional arguments:
    ALGORITHM_NAME        Algorithm to use to cipher.
    CIPHERING_KEY         Key to use to cipher.
    FILE_TO_CIPHER        Path to file with text to cipher.

##### optional arguments:
     -o OUTPUT_CIPHERED_FILE, --ciphered_file OUTPUT_CIPHERED_FILE
                        Path to output file to place ciphered text. If not
                        used then deciphered text will be dumped to console.
     -c CHARSET, --charset CHARSET
                        Default charset is: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefgh
                        ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890 !?., but you can set here
                        another.

## Attack
Attack a ciphered text to get its plain text.

`$ cifra attack ALGORITHM_NAME FILE_TO_ATTACK`

##### positional arguments:
    ALGORITHM_NAME        Algorithm to attack.
    FILE_TO_ATTACK        Path to file with text to attack.

##### optional arguments:
     -o OUTPUT_CIPHERED_FILE, --ciphered_file OUTPUT_CIPHERED_FILE
                        Path to output file to place deciphered text. If not
                        used then deciphered text will be dumped to console.
     -c CHARSET, --charset CHARSET
                        Default charset is: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefgh
                        ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890 !?., but you can set here
                        another.
