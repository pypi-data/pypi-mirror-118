A Python Wrapper for the FLTK library
-------------------------------------

GOALS:

* To wrap FLTK1.3 in Python 
* To port all programs in test/ to Python using pyFLTK
 

If you'd like to help out, I'd suggest using the pyfltk mailing list
(at the bottom) to coordinate who's working on what. 

1) This wrapper requires:

* SWIG 4.0 or later
* Python 3.8 or later
* Fast Light Toolkit 1.3.7 or later (it will also work with earlier versions)

2) Restrictions

At present, the Python wrapper has been ported and is stable.
A preliminary release of flconvert is available but work on it has stopped.
   

3) The wrapper is available on PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/pyFltk/

4) To build the wrappers yourself do the following: (see INSTALL for more
   details):
   

	
	python setup.py swig (not required if you downloaded the _WithSwig source)
	
	python setup.py build
	
	python setup.py install
   
   
   You might have to edit setup.py to fit your platform. 
   
   
5) Do the following to run some tests:


	
	cd fltk/test
	
	python hello.py
    or
    python3 hello.py (depending on your platform)


* ./test contains demo programs from the FLTK distribution reimplemented
  in Python.
* You can run ./test/demos.py for a little
  menu of the demos

### Thanks:

Especial thanks to Kevin Dalhausen, the originator of pyFLTK. He did
such a good job, the rest was easy.

Many thanks to the creators of fltk (www.fltk.org), the best, fastest
and lightest toolkit there is!

Finally, not to forget the creators of SWIG (www.swig.org) a unique
tool for doing what we've done here.
