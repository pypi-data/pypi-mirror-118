# courselevels

Jupyter notebook extension for background colouring selected cells.

Install via:

`pip install nb-courselevels`

The extension should be automatically installed and enabled.

Three buttons are provided that toggle the colour of selected cells
(1 finger = basic, 2 fingers = intermediate, 4 fingers = advanced/expert)
In addition a button allows to add a frame around the selected cells.

This is designed for flagging course contents, so that students can better navigate it :

- basic (green)
