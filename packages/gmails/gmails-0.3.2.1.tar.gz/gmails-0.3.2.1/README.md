GMails - A simple GMail message retriever
=========================================

A naive wrapper library that uses the Python GMail SDK.

The uses for this library are primarily for the retrieval of emails in a given search term and date range.

Logging in is handled by OAuth helped by a native browser window.

It requires use of GCP keys that need to be retrieved from the GCP console.
