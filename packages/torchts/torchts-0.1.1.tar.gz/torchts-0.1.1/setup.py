Traditional time series methods from statistics often rely on strong modeling assumptions, or are computationally expensive. Given the rise of large-scale sensing data and significant advances in deep learning, the goal of the project is to develop an efficient and user-friendly deep learning library that would benefit the entire research community and beyond.\n\n#### Why TorchTS?\n\nExisting time series analysis libraries include [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) and [sktime](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime). However, these libraries only include traditional statistics tools such as ARMA or ARIMA, which do not have the state-of-the-art forecasting tools based on deep learning. [GluonTS](https://ts.gluon.ai/) is an open-source time series library developed by Amazon AWS, but is based on MXNet. [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/) is a probabilistic programming framework based on PyTorch, but is not focused on time series forecasting.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installation Requirements\n\nTorchTS supports Python 3.7+ and has the following dependencies:\n\n- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)\n- [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorchlightning.ai/)\n- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)\n\n### Installing the latest release\n\nThe latest release of TorchTS is easily installed either via `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install torchts\n```\n\nor via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/) from the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) channel (coming soon):\n\n```bash\nconda install torchts -c conda-forge\n```\n\nYou can customize your PyTorch installation (i.e. CUDA version, CPU only option)\nby following the [PyTorch installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n\n***Important note for MacOS users:***\n\n- Make sure your PyTorch build is linked against MKL (the non-optimized version\n  of TorchTS can be up to an order of magnitude slower in some settings).\n  Setting this up manually on MacOS can be tricky - to ensure this works properly,\n  please follow the [PyTorch installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n- If you need CUDA on MacOS, you will need to build PyTorch from source. Please\n  consult the PyTorch installation instructions above.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nCheck out our [documentation](https://rose-stl-lab.github.io/torchTS/) and\n[tutorials](https://rose-stl-lab.github.io/torchTS/tutorials) (coming soon).\n\n## Citing TorchTS\n\nIf you use TorchTS, please cite the following paper (coming soon):\n\n> [TorchTS: A Framework for Efficient Time Series Modeling](TBD)\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{TBD,\n  title={{TorchTS: A Framework for Efficient Time Series Modeling}},\n  author={TBD},\n  booktitle = {TBD},\n  year={TBD},\n  url = {TBD}\n}\n```\n\nSee [here](https://rose-stl-lab.github.io/torchTS/papers) (coming soon) for a selection of peer-reviewed papers that either build off of TorchTS or were integrated into TorchTS.\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing to TorchTS? Please see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to help out.\n\n## License\n\nTorchTS is [MIT licensed](LICENSE).\n',
