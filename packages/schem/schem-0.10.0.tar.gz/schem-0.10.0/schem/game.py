    """Wrapper for Solution.run which identifies the level to run in as needed, based on the solution metadata.

    Run the given solution, and return the (cycles, reactors, symbols) Score obtained. Raise an error if the solution
    cannot run to completion or exceeds max_cycles.

    Args:
        soln_str: Solution string as exported by SpaceChem Community Edition.
        level_code / level_codes: Puzzle export string or strings (only one or the other arg may be provided).
            If multiple levels are given, solution will be run against all with titles matching the level title in its
            metadata, and an exception raised if none match. If only one level is provided, the solution will be run
            against it, irrespective of title.

            If level_code(s) is not provided, the level name from the solution metadata is used to search for a matching
            built-in game level(s).

            When multiple built-in or provided level titles match the solution's metadata, the solution will be run
            against all in turn until one matches the expected score. If no level matches the expected score, the first
            successful run's score will be returned. If the solution does not complete any of the levels, an exception
            is raised.
            Note that while some built-in game levels have duplicate titles, currently all of these have conflicting
            level features (bonders etc.), and therefore a solution can't successfully load into / solve multiple
            built-in levels.
        max_cycles: Maximum cycle count to run to. Default double the expected cycle count in the solution metadata,
            or 1,000,000 cycles if no expected score (use math.inf if you don't fear infinite loop solutions).
        return_json: If True, instead of a Score return a dict including the usual score fields, but also the level
            title, ResearchNet volume-issue-puzzle tuple (None if not a ResearchNet level), and solution author/title.

            Additionally, raise an exception only if the solution cannot be imported into any level; if the solution
            encounters a reaction error or exceeds max_cycles, just return None in the dict's 'cycles' field and
            return the metadata of the first level that the solution could be successfully imported into.

            Default False.
        verbose: If True, print warnings if there is not exactly one level with title matching the solution metadata.
                 Default False.
        debug: Print an updating view of the solution while running; see DebugOptions. Default False.
